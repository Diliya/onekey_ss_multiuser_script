# onekey_ss_multiuser_script
Thanks lasyman!Just update some code to suit the ubuntu 16.04


Former script link:https://github.com/lasyman/lasyman_setup_ss


Use the shell script to setup shadowsocks on Ubuntu 1604 or CentOs 6.5

1. First you must git clone this script to your VPS

2. Run it by command # bash lasyman_setup_ss.sh(if you get an error when running the script.Please run dos2unix before.)

3. After the script done, you can visit your VPS IP to see the result

4. Goodluck man!
